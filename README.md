# Logical Reasoning with Python

This repository contains Python programs for logical reasoning and inference using propositional logic. It includes a custom logic engine implemented in `logic.py` and two example problems: `harry.py` and `murder_mystery.py`.

## Project Structure

- `logic.py`: A Python module defining logical operations and model evaluation functions.
- `harry.py`: A logic puzzle involving characters from the Harry Potter universe.
- `murder_mystery.py`: A Clue-style murder mystery solver using logical inference.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Additionally, install the `termcolor`(optional) package for colored output:

```bash
pip install termcolor
```

## Usage

Run the example scripts using:

```bash
python harry.py
python murder_mystery.py
```

Each script will output logical deductions based on the provided knowledge base.
